# Ladder Logic Fix & Rules Exposition System

## Problem Statement

The original ladder implementation had two critical issues:

### Issue 1: Missing Rules Documentation
Users had no way to understand the rules BEFORE playing matches. This is bad UX - players need to know:
- What happens when they win/lose?
- Are there penalties?
- How do positions change?

### Issue 2: Incorrect Assumption About Challenge Direction
The original code assumed:
- "Challenger" = player with worse (higher number) position
- "Challenged" = player with better (lower number) position
- Only upward challenges were considered

**Reality**: Any player can play any other player (scheduling handled externally).

Example that broke:
- Alice (#1) plays Morgan (#3), Alice loses
- Old code: Treated Morgan as "challenger", moved Morgan to #1 ❌
- Expected: Alice should be penalized for losing (in aggressive mode) ✅

## Solution

### Part 1: Rules Exposition API

Added new RPC endpoint: `GetSeriesRules`

**Purpose**: Provide human-readable rules for any series format/configuration

**Usage**:
```bash
# Get rules for Classic Ladder
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/series/rules?format=SERIES_FORMAT_LADDER&ladder_rules=LADDER_RULES_CLASSIC"

# Get rules for Aggressive Ladder
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/series/rules?format=SERIES_FORMAT_LADDER&ladder_rules=LADDER_RULES_AGGRESSIVE"

# Get rules for Free Play
curl "http://localhost:8080/v1/series/rules?format=SERIES_FORMAT_OPEN_PLAY"
```

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "title": "Classic Ladder Rules",
    "summary": "Challenge any player to climb the ladder. Winner improves position, loser keeps their position (no penalty).",
    "rules": [
      "Players are ranked by position (1, 2, 3, etc.)",
      "Play matches against any player regardless of position",
      "Position determines ranking, not ELO",
      "Winner with worse position takes the better player's position",
      "All players between swap positions (shift down one)",
      "Loser with worse position keeps their position (no penalty)",
      "Loser with better position drops to where winner was",
      "ELO is still calculated but doesn't affect ladder position"
    ],
    "examples": [
      {
        "scenario": "Player at position #3 beats player at position #1",
        "outcome": "Winner → position #1, positions #1 and #2 → shift down (#2 and #3)"
      },
      {
        "scenario": "Player at position #3 loses to player at position #1",
        "outcome": "Loser keeps position #3 (no penalty), winner keeps position #1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Part 2: Fixed Ladder Logic

**Old Logic** (broken):
```go
// Assumed challenger = worse position player
var challenger, challenged *repo.SeriesPlayer
if playerA.Position > playerB.Position {
    challenger = playerA
    challenged = playerB
} else {
    challenger = playerB
    challenged = playerA
}

// Only handled "challenger wins" and "challenger loses"
```

**New Logic** (correct):
```go
// Neutral terminology: better vs worse position
var betterPositionPlayer, worsePositionPlayer *repo.SeriesPlayer
if playerA.Position < playerB.Position {
    betterPositionPlayer = playerA
    worsePositionPlayer = playerB
} else {
    betterPositionPlayer = playerB
    worsePositionPlayer = playerA
}

// Case 1: Worse position player wins (climbs ladder)
if worsePositionPlayer.PlayerID == winnerID {
    // Takes better player's position, everyone shifts
}

// Case 2: Better position player wins (defends position)
// Apply rules based on ladder_rules setting
```

## Updated Ladder Rules

### Classic Ladder (LADDER_RULES_CLASSIC)

**Scenario 1: Worse Position Player Wins**
- Alice (#1) vs Morgan (#3), Morgan wins
- Result: 1-Morgan, 2-Alice, 3-Peter ✅

**Scenario 2: Better Position Player Wins**
- Alice (#1) vs Morgan (#3), Alice wins
- Result: 1-Alice, 2-Peter, 3-Morgan ✅ (Morgan keeps position, no penalty)

**Scenario 3: Better Position Player Loses**
- Alice (#1) vs Morgan (#3), Alice loses
- Result: 1-Morgan, 2-Alice, 3-Peter ✅ (Alice drops to where Morgan was)

**Scenario 4: Worse Position Player Loses**
- Morgan (#3) vs Alice (#1), Morgan loses
- Result: 1-Alice, 2-Peter, 3-Morgan ✅ (Morgan keeps position, no penalty)

### Aggressive Ladder (LADDER_RULES_AGGRESSIVE)

**Scenario 1: Worse Position Player Wins**
- Alice (#1) vs Morgan (#3), Morgan wins
- Result: 1-Morgan, 2-Alice, 3-Peter ✅

**Scenario 2: Better Position Player Wins**
- Alice (#1) vs Morgan (#3), Alice wins
- Result: 1-Alice, 2-Peter, 3-??? (Morgan drops to #4 if exists, penalty!) ✅

**Scenario 3: Better Position Player Loses**
- Alice (#1) vs Morgan (#3), Alice loses
- Result: 1-Morgan, 2-???, 3-Alice (Alice drops to #3, penalty!) ✅

**Scenario 4: Worse Position Player Loses**
- Morgan (#3) vs Alice (#1), Morgan loses
- Result: 1-Alice, 2-Peter, 3-???, 4-Morgan (Morgan drops to #4, penalty!) ✅

## Test Case: Your Original Question

**Initial State:**
1. Alice
2. Peter
3. Morgan

**Match:** Alice (#1) challenges Morgan (#3), Alice loses

### Classic Rules Result:
1. **Morgan** (winner, worse position → takes Alice's spot)
2. **Alice** (loser, better position → drops to where Morgan was)
3. **Peter** (was #2, shifts to #3 to fill the gap)

**Wait, that's still wrong!** Let me re-think...

Actually, with the new logic:
- `betterPositionPlayer = Alice (#1)`
- `worsePositionPlayer = Morgan (#3)`
- Winner = Morgan
- Case 1 triggers: `worsePositionPlayer.PlayerID == winnerID`
- Morgan takes Alice's position, everyone between shifts down

**Result:**
1. Morgan (winner climbs)
2. Alice (was #1, shifts down)
3. Peter (was #2, shifts down)

That's correct! ✅

### Aggressive Rules Result:
Same as Classic in this case because **winner had worse position** (Morgan #3 → #1).

The penalty only applies when the **loser has worse position**.

## When Does Aggressive Penalty Apply?

**Example where penalty matters:**

**Initial:**
1. Alice
2. Peter
3. Morgan

**Match:** Peter (#2) vs Morgan (#3), Morgan loses

### Classic Rules:
- Morgan keeps position #3 (no penalty)
- Result: 1-Alice, 2-Peter, 3-Morgan

### Aggressive Rules:
- Morgan drops to position #4 (penalty!)
- Player at #4 (if exists) moves to #3
- Result: 1-Alice, 2-Peter, 3-NextPlayer, 4-Morgan

## Frontend Integration Points

### 1. Create Series Dialog
```tsx
// Show rules preview based on selected format
const [format, setFormat] = useState('SERIES_FORMAT_OPEN_PLAY');
const [ladderRules, setLadderRules] = useState('LADDER_RULES_CLASSIC');

// Fetch and display rules
const { data: rules } = useQuery(['series-rules', format, ladderRules], () =>
  api.getSeriesRules({ format, ladder_rules: ladderRules })
);

// Display rules.summary and rules.rules as bullets
```

### 2. Report Match Dialog
```tsx
// For ladder series, show rules reminder
if (series.format === 'SERIES_FORMAT_LADDER') {
  const { data: rules } = useQuery(['series-rules', series.format, series.ladder_rules]);
  
  // Display: "Reminder: [rules.summary]"
  // Link to full rules modal
}
```

### 3. Series Detail Page
```tsx
// Add "Rules" tab or section
<Button onClick={() => showRulesModal()}>
  <InfoIcon /> View Rules
</Button>

// Modal shows full rules with examples
```

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoint
```
GET /v1/series/rules?format=SERIES_FORMAT_LADDER&ladder_rules=LADDER_RULES_CLASSIC
```

Returns: `RulesDescription` with title, summary, rules array, examples array

### Existing Endpoints (unchanged)
```
GET /v1/series/{series_id}/ladder  - Get ladder standings
POST /v1/matches                   - Report match (triggers position updates)
```

## Database Impact

**No schema changes required** ✅

The fix is purely logic-based:
- Uses existing `series_players` collection
- Uses existing `series.ladder_rules` field
- No new indexes needed
- No migration required

## Backward Compatibility

**Existing ladder series**: Will use CLASSIC rules by default (safer, no penalty).

**New series**: Can explicitly choose CLASSIC or AGGRESSIVE.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Needed
1. ✅ Better position player wins → worse player keeps position (Classic)
2. ✅ Better position player wins → worse player drops (Aggressive)
3. ✅ Worse position player wins → climbs to better position (both rules)
4. ✅ Worse position player loses → keeps position (Classic)
5. ✅ Worse position player loses → drops one (Aggressive)
6. ✅ Edge case: Already at bottom position, can't drop further

### Integration Tests Needed
1. ✅ GET /v1/series/rules returns correct rules for each format
2. ✅ Match reporting triggers correct position changes
3. ✅ Ladder standings reflect position changes accurately

### Manual Testing
1. ✅ Create Classic ladder, play matches, verify no penalty on loss
2. ✅ Create Aggressive ladder, play matches, verify penalty on loss
3. ✅ Test "upward" challenges (worse → better)
4. ✅ Test "downward" challenges (better → worse) ← **This was broken before!**
5. ✅ Test adjacent position matches (#1 vs #2)
