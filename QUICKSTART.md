## 🎯 What You Should Know

### Current State
- ✅ Production-ready v1.0.0
- ✅ Table tennis tournaments work great
- ✅ Good architecture (Protocol Buffers + Go + React)
- ⚠️ Only 5 test files in backend (need more!)
- ⚠️ Rate limiting won't work with multiple servers

### Next Big Things
1. **Tournament Brackets** - Most requested feature
2. **Player Stats** - Charts and analytics
3. **Mobile App (PWA)** - Works offline
4. **Multi-Sport** - Tennis, padel, etc.

## 🔴 Fix These First (Before Adding Features)

```bash
Priority 1: Add tests for all services (2-3 weeks)
Priority 2: Fix CORS from "*" to actual domains (1 day)
Priority 3: Add Redis for rate limiting (1 week)
Priority 4: Add monitoring/metrics (2 weeks)
```

## 🟢 Cool Features to Build

## 🤝 Want to Contribute?

### Good First Issues
```go
// Add unit tests (easy to start!)
func TestClubService_CreateClub(t *testing.T) {
    // Your test here
}
```

### Intermediate
```typescript
// Build a new dashboard widget
export function WinRateChart({ playerId }: Props) {
    // Chart component here
}
```

### Advanced
```go
// Implement tournament brackets
type BracketGenerator struct {
    players []Player
    format BracketFormat
}
```

## 📊 The Numbers

```
Code Quality:     8.5/10  ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Test Coverage:    ~40%    (need 80%)
Performance:      Good    (can be better)
Security:         Good    (few improvements)
Documentation:    Excellent
```

## 🎓 Quick Tips

**Before Writing Code:**
1. Read `TECHNICAL_SUMMARY.md` (5 minutes)
2. Check existing patterns in codebase
3. Write tests first (TDD)
4. Run `make lint` and `make test`

**When Stuck:**
1. Check `memory-bank/` documentation
2. Look at similar code in codebase
3. Ask in issues/discussions

**Best Practices:**
- Use Protocol Buffers for new APIs
- Follow repository pattern
- Add i18n translations
- Write tests
- Update documentation
