## 🎓 Code Quality Observations

### ✅ What's Working Well
- **Clean Architecture**: Excellent separation of concerns (service/repo pattern)
- **Type Safety**: Protocol Buffers ensure end-to-end type safety
- **Documentation**: Exceptional documentation in memory-bank
- **Build System**: Robust Make-based workflow with clear timing expectations
- **Security**: Good JWT implementation, input validation, and GDPR framework

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- **Test Coverage**: Only 5 backend test files, need 30+ for comprehensive coverage
- **Observability**: No metrics, tracing, or APM (blind in production)
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory only, won't work with horizontal scaling
- **Performance**: Some O(n) algorithms that could be O(1) with caching
- **Mobile UX**: Works on mobile but not optimized (no PWA features)

---

## 🔒 Security Posture

### Strong Points ✅
- JWT-based authentication
- Parameterized MongoDB queries (injection-safe)
- Input validation (client + server)
- GDPR framework implementation
- Rate limiting in place

### Needs Attention ⚠️
- CORS wildcard (`*`) too permissive
- Token rotation not implemented
- No security headers audit trail
- Missing automated security scanning in CI
- GDPR integration not fully activated

**Security Score: 7.5/10** - Good foundation, needs hardening
