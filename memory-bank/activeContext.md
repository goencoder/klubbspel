# Active Context: Klubbspel

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Focus**: Finalizing generalized match reporting and series configuration (PR #12)
- Branch: `codex/extend-and-update-proto-files-for-sports`
- Active Pull Request: "Finalize generalized match reporting and series config"

**Current Session**: Setting up comprehensive Memory Bank documentation system for improved context preservation and development workflow.

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Implementation (Current Session)
- âœ… Installed mcp-memory-bank and playwright MCP servers in VS Code
- âœ… Created complete Memory Bank structure in `/memory-bank/` directory
- âœ… Generated all 7 required Memory Bank files with project-specific content
- ðŸ”„ Currently documenting active development context

### Previous Development Activity
- **Match Reporting Enhancements**: Working on generalizing match reporting system for sports beyond table tennis
- **Series Configuration**: Extending tournament series configuration options
- **Proto File Updates**: Updating Protocol Buffer definitions to support generalized sports functionality
- **Development Environment**: Recently stopped development services (`make host-stop`)
- **File Recovery**: Restored `frontend/src/components/ReportMatchDialog.tsx` from HEAD

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Complete Memory Bank Setup**: Finish creating progress.md file
2. **Memory Bank Validation**: Review all Memory Bank files for accuracy and completeness
3. **Development Environment**: Restart development environment (`make host-dev`)
4. **Active Work Resumption**: Return to PR #12 work with improved context

### Short Term (Next 1-2 Sessions)
1. **Finalize PR #12**: Complete generalized match reporting and series config work
2. **Testing**: Run comprehensive test suite (`make test-integration`)
3. **Code Quality**: Ensure all linting and quality checks pass
4. **Documentation**: Update any changed APIs in the Memory Bank

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. **PR Review and Merge**: Get PR #12 reviewed and merged
2. **Deployment Testing**: Validate changes in staging environment
3. **User Testing**: Test new match reporting flows with real tournament scenarios
4. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor ELO calculation performance with new features

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Memory Bank Integration
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive Memory Bank for context preservation between AI sessions
- **Rationale**: Complex project with multiple systems requires detailed context documentation
- **Impact**: Future development sessions will have complete project context immediately available

### MCP Server Selection
- **Memory Bank MCP**: For structured documentation and context preservation
- **Playwright MCP**: For automated UI testing and validation of user workflows
- **Integration**: Both servers complement the existing development workflow documented in copilot-instructions.md

### Development Workflow Enhancement
- **Pattern**: Always update Memory Bank when significant changes occur
- **Validation**: Use Playwright MCP for automated testing of complete user workflows
- **Documentation**: Keep Memory Bank synchronized with actual codebase state

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Quality Standards
- **Never Skip Quality Checks**: Always run `make lint`, `make test`, and manual validation
- **End-to-End Validation**: Test complete user workflows in browser after any changes
- **Timeout Awareness**: All build commands have specific timeout expectations (documented in copilot-instructions.md)
- **Error Prevention**: Use structured approach with proper context gathering before making changes

### Development Workflow Patterns
- **Clean Environment**: Start with `make host-dev` for predictable development state
- **Incremental Testing**: Test immediately after changes using `make host-restart`
- **Manual Validation**: Always verify changes in browser UI, not just API responses
- **Documentation First**: Update documentation before implementing complex changes

### Architecture Preferences
- **API-First Design**: All new features start with protobuf API definition
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript and Go typing throughout the system
- **Repository Pattern**: Keep business logic separate from data access
- **Event-Driven**: Use events for cross-service communication (especially ELO updates)

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Memory Bank System Benefits
- **Context Preservation**: Eliminates need to rediscover project structure and patterns
- **Consistent Development**: Provides reliable foundation for AI-assisted development
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Captures architectural decisions and development patterns
- **Quality Assurance**: Documents validation workflows and quality standards

### Klubbspel Development Insights
- **Build Timing Critical**: Many commands require 30+ second timeouts; never cancel prematurely
- **Integration Testing Essential**: Unit tests alone insufficient for tournament management complexity
- **Manual Validation Required**: UI workflows must be tested manually for complete validation
- **Environment Consistency**: Docker development environment crucial for reliable development

### Technical Architecture Strengths
- **gRPC + REST**: Dual API approach provides flexibility for different client needs
- **Protocol Buffers**: Strong typing across frontend/backend boundary eliminates integration errors
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation enables easy testing and maintenance
- **Make-based Automation**: Simple, reliable build system that works across all platforms

### Development Process Learnings
- **Quality Checks Non-Negotiable**: Linting, testing, and manual validation prevent deployment issues
- **Documentation Investment**: Time spent on comprehensive documentation pays dividends in development speed
- **Timeout Expectations**: Understanding build timing prevents premature cancellation and failed builds
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflows reveal issues that unit tests miss

### Current Development State
- **Environment**: Currently stopped, needs restart with `make host-dev`
- **Branch State**: Working on feature branch with active pull request
- **Next Session Preparation**: Memory Bank now provides complete context for immediate productivity
