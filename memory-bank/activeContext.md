## Project Status
**Production Release**: Klubbspel v1.0.0 is a stable, production-ready table tennis tournament management system serving Swedish clubs with comprehensive features for player management, match reporting, and real-time ELO rankings.

**Open Source**: Released under open source license, welcoming community contributions and feedback.

## Core Capabilities Delivered
- **Complete Tournament Management**: End-to-end series creation, player registration, match reporting, and live leaderboards
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with proper request cancellation handling and user-friendly error messages
- **Production Quality**: Full test coverage (unit, integration, and UI tests), internationalization support, and secure authentication
- **Developer Experience**: Well-documented build system, clear architecture patterns, and comprehensive development guidelines
- **Data Integrity**: Player merging system, duplicate detection, and validated match scoring rules

## Active Development Focus

### Multi-Sport Framework
**Status**: Architectural foundation established with Sport enum and MatchParticipant structure. Table tennis fully implemented as the primary sport.
**Extension Points**: Ready for community contributions to add tennis, padel, or other racket sports.
**Design**: Extensible service layer allows sport-specific validation and scoring rules.

### Mobile Experience
**Status**: Fully responsive web application optimized for mobile browsers.
**Future Considerations**: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities or native mobile apps based on community feedback and usage patterns.

### Advanced Features
**Status**: Core tournament functionality complete with ELO-based rankings and series management.
**Extension Opportunities**: Bracket tournaments, advanced scheduling, and elimination formats can be added as community needs arise.

## Architecture Principles

### Development Quality Standards
- **Never Cancel Long Operations**: Build commands have specific timing expectations (documented in copilot-instructions.md)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Three-tier testing strategy (unit, integration, UI) ensures reliability
- **Type Safety First**: Protocol buffers provide end-to-end type safety from database to UI
- **Localization Required**: Full Swedish/English internationalization across all user-facing text

### Code Organization
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between service, repository, and transport layers
- **API-First Design**: Protocol buffer definitions serve as the single source of truth for all interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with localization keys for user-friendly messages
- **Validation Layers**: Dual validation (client and server) ensures data integrity

### User Experience Philosophy
- **Swedish-First**: Native Swedish interface designed for Swedish table tennis clubs
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time leaderboard updates and instant match result processing
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation prevents invalid data entry
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Touch-optimized interface for all screen sizes

## Project Architecture Highlights

### Technical Decisions
- **Protocol Buffers**: Provides type safety, versioning, and automatic code generation
- **gRPC + REST Gateway**: High-performance gRPC with REST compatibility for broad client support
- **MongoDB**: Document model fits flexible tournament structures with built-in indexing
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction enables thorough testing
- **Host Development**: Fast iteration with MongoDB in Docker, services on host machine

### Feature Highlights
- **Player Duplicate Management**: Intelligent normalization and merging prevents data fragmentation
- **Real-time Leaderboards**: Automatic ELO calculation with instant ranking updates
- **Table Tennis Validation**: Sport-specific scoring rules ensure match result accuracy
- **CSV Export**: Administrative data export for league reporting and external analysis
- **Club Administration**: Role-based access control with admin and member permissions

### Production Readiness
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with unit, integration, and UI coverage
- **Security**: JWT authentication, input validation, and parameterized database queries
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, structured logging, and error tracking
- **Deployment**: Docker-based deployment with infrastructure-as-code configuration
- **Documentation**: Extensive developer guides and architectural documentation
