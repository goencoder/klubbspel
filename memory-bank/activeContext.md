# Active Context: Klubbspel

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Creation and Future Planning**: Establishing comprehensive project documentation to enable better task planning and development continuity. The project is in a mature state with core functionality implemented, now focusing on identifying optimization opportunities and new feature development.

**Current Branch**: `copilot/fix-0e404597-788d-4654-a262-5d9877e4a487` - Working on improvements and preparing for future development iterations.

## Recent Changes
- **Request Cancellation Fix**: Implemented comprehensive solution to eliminate "Request cancelled" toast notifications that were appearing during normal navigation and component unmounting
- **Error Handling Enhancement**: Added `RequestCancelledError` class and utility functions for consistent error handling across the application  
- **API Client Improvement**: Updated API service to properly distinguish between actual errors and expected request cancellations
- **Component Updates**: Enhanced error handling in key components (SeriesDetailPage, LeaderboardPage, ClubsPage, useInfiniteDropdown)
- **Memory Bank Implementation**: Created comprehensive project documentation structure with all core files
- **Project Analysis**: Conducted thorough analysis of existing codebase and functionality

## Next Steps
- **Task Identification**: Use Memory Bank analysis to identify high-value enhancement opportunities
- **Feature Prioritization**: Evaluate potential new features against user needs and technical complexity
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify areas for improvement in existing functionality
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Look for opportunities to streamline workflows and improve usability

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Multi-Sport Framework Expansion
**Current State**: Foundation exists with Sport enum and MatchParticipant structure, but only table tennis is fully implemented.
**Consideration**: Whether to complete multi-sport support (tennis, padel) or focus on table tennis enhancements.
**Decision Factor**: User demand vs. development effort trade-off.

### Mobile Application Strategy
**Current State**: Responsive web application works on mobile devices.
**Consideration**: Whether to develop native mobile apps or enhance PWA capabilities.
**Decision Factor**: User engagement metrics and development resource allocation.

### Advanced Tournament Features
**Current State**: Basic series management with ELO rankings.
**Consideration**: Adding bracket tournaments, elimination formats, or advanced scheduling.
**Decision Factor**: Club feedback and competitive landscape analysis.

### Data Analytics and Reporting
**Current State**: Basic CSV export functionality.
**Consideration**: Advanced analytics, player performance insights, and club statistics.
**Decision Factor**: Administrative user needs and data visualization complexity.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Development Quality Standards
- **Never Cancel Long Operations**: Build commands have specific timing expectations and should not be interrupted
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All changes require unit tests, integration tests, and manual validation
- **Type Safety First**: Protocol buffers drive type safety from backend to frontend
- **Localization Required**: All user-facing strings must support Swedish and English

### Code Organization Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: Service/Repository/Transport layer separation maintained consistently
- **API-First Design**: Protocol buffer definitions drive all interface contracts
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with proper localization keys
- **Validation Layers**: Client-side and server-side validation for data integrity

### User Experience Philosophy
- **Swedish-First**: Native Swedish interface with English as secondary language
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time updates for rankings and match results
- **Data Integrity**: Prevent invalid data entry through comprehensive validation
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Touch-friendly interface for all screen sizes

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Architecture Success
- **Protocol Buffers**: Excellent choice for type safety and API contract management
- **Host Development**: Fast iteration cycle with MongoDB in Docker, services on host
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation enables easy testing and maintenance
- **Build System**: Make-based workflow provides consistent, reliable builds

### User Experience Insights
- **Player Duplicate Management**: Critical feature that prevents data integrity issues
- **Real-time Leaderboards**: High user engagement with immediate ELO updates
- **Table Tennis Validation**: Proper scoring rules prevent invalid match results
- **CSV Export**: Essential feature for club administrators and league reporting

### Development Workflow Optimizations
- **Timing Expectations**: Understanding build timing prevents premature cancellation
- **Quality Checks**: Automated linting and testing catch issues early
- **Manual Testing**: Complete user workflows validate integration between components
- **Error Localization**: Proper error message translation improves user experience

### Future Considerations Identified
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Need metrics on API response times and database query performance
2. **User Analytics**: Understanding feature usage patterns could guide development priorities
3. **Backup and Recovery**: Data export is good start, but need comprehensive backup strategy
4. **Scalability Planning**: Current single-instance architecture may need horizontal scaling
5. **Security Auditing**: Regular security reviews as user base grows
