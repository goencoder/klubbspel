## Version History

### v1.2.0 (Planned) - Multi-Sport Expansion
**Status**: In Development (PR #21 + scoring improvements)

**New Sports Added**:
- Badminton support with Wind icon
- Squash support with Zap icon
- Padel support with Swords icon
- Pickleball support with CircleDot icon

**Scoring Improvements**:
- Extended sets_to_play validation from 3-5 to 3-7 (supports best-of-7 matches)
- Made "Sets to Play" field visible for ALL racket/paddle sports (not just table tennis)
- Added "Best of 7" option in UI dropdown
- Dynamic validation hints based on actual series.setsToPlay configuration
- TypeScript types updated for all new sports
- Translations added for bestOf7 in Swedish and English

**Technical Debt Identified**:
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: All sports currently share same validation logic (`validateTableTennisScore()`)
- No sport-specific validation rules implemented
- Squash cannot support draws (some leagues allow this)
- No framework for sport-specific configuration (sets vs games, point limits, etc.)

**Future Requirement**: Sport-specific validation framework needed before adding:
- Dart (checkout rules, 301/501 scoring)
- Chess (time controls, draw rules, checkmate vs stalemate)
- Fishing (weight-based scoring, catch-and-release)
- Golf (stroke/match play, handicaps)

### v1.1.0 (October 2025)
**Minor Release**: Tennis Support

**Features Added**:
- Tennis as second supported sport
- Sport-specific icons (CircleDot for table tennis, Circle for tennis)
- Multi-sport club configuration

**Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed 501 error for tennis matches (missing switch case in match_service.go)
- Fixed non-existent Lucide icons (TableTennis, TennisBall)
- Fixed translation namespace (sport.* → sports.*)
- Created CODEX_ADD_SPORTS.md guide to prevent future issues
