## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Technical Debt
- **Single Database Instance**: No horizontal scaling support for database layer
- **Limited Caching**: No external caching layer for improved performance
- **Basic Error Handling**: Error messages could be more user-friendly in some scenarios
- **Manual Testing Required**: Some user workflows still require manual validation

### Performance Considerations
- **Large Tournament Scaling**: Performance testing needed for tournaments with 500+ players
- **Concurrent User Load**: Testing required for high concurrent user scenarios
- **Database Query Optimization**: Some complex leaderboard queries could be optimized further
- **Frontend Bundle Size**: Frontend JavaScript bundle could be optimized for faster loading

### User Experience Gaps
- **Mobile Optimization**: While responsive, native mobile experience could be improved
- **Accessibility**: Full accessibility compliance (WCAG) not yet validated
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Some UI components lack optimal keyboard navigation support
- **Offline Graceful Degradation**: Limited functionality when network connectivity is poor

### Development Workflow Issues
- **Build Time**: Initial builds can take 60+ seconds, impacting development speed
- **Test Coverage**: Frontend test coverage could be expanded beyond current Playwright tests
- **Documentation**: API documentation could be more comprehensive with examples
- **Development Dependencies**: Complex setup process for new developers

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Evolution
**Initial Decision**: Simple REST API with basic database
**Current State**: Full gRPC + REST gateway with Protocol Buffers
**Reasoning**: Strong typing and performance requirements drove adoption of gRPC
**Impact**: Significantly improved type safety and API consistency

### Frontend Technology Evolution
**Initial Decision**: Basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript
**Current State**: React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + GitHub Spark
**Reasoning**: Need for maintainable, scalable frontend with strong typing
**Impact**: Faster development cycles and fewer runtime errors

### Database Choice Evolution
**Initial Decision**: PostgreSQL with relational model
**Current State**: MongoDB with document model
**Reasoning**: Tournament data is naturally hierarchical and flexible
**Impact**: Simpler data modeling and easier evolution of tournament formats

### Testing Strategy Evolution
**Initial Decision**: Manual testing only
**Current State**: Multi-layered testing with unit, integration, and E2E tests
**Reasoning**: Quality requirements and complexity demanded automated testing
**Impact**: Higher confidence in deployments and faster bug detection

### Development Workflow Evolution
**Initial Decision**: Simple scripts and manual processes
**Current State**: Make-based automation with Docker development environment
**Reasoning**: Team efficiency and consistency requirements
**Impact**: Faster onboarding and more reliable development process

### Internationalization Approach
**Initial Decision**: English-only interface
**Current State**: Full Swedish/English localization system
**Reasoning**: Target market in Sweden requires native language support
**Impact**: Broader user adoption and better user experience in target market

### Memory Bank Integration (Latest)
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive Memory Bank documentation system
**Reasoning**: Complex project requires detailed context preservation for AI-assisted development
**Expected Impact**: Faster development sessions, better context retention, improved code quality
