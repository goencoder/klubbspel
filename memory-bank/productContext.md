# Product Context: Klubbspel

## Problem Statement
Swedish table tennis clubs currently lack a comprehensive, modern tournament management system that handles the complete lifecycle of club tournaments. Existing solutions are either too complex for casual club use, lack proper internationalization for Swedish clubs, or don't provide the real-time ranking and match reporting features that modern players expect. 

**Key Problems Solved:**
- **Manual Tournament Management**: Eliminates spreadsheet-based tracking with automated ELO calculations
- **Player Identity Issues**: Solves duplicate player problems with intelligent normalization (Erik/Eric conflicts)
- **Language Barriers**: Provides native Swedish interface with proper localization
- **Real-time Rankings**: Delivers live leaderboards instead of static, outdated rankings
- **Match Result Integrity**: Ensures proper table tennis scoring validation and prevents invalid results
- **Club Organization**: Centralizes member management and multi-club tournament coordination
