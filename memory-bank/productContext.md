# Product Context: Klubbspel

## Problem Statement
Table tennis tournament management currently relies on manual processes, spreadsheets, and disconnected tools that create administrative burden and lead to errors. Tournament organizers struggle with:

- **Manual Score Tracking**: Paper scoresheets and manual entry into spreadsheets prone to errors
- **Rating Calculations**: Complex ELO calculations done manually or with basic spreadsheet formulas
- **Real-time Updates**: Difficulty providing players with current standings during tournaments
- **Player Management**: Disconnected systems for managing player registration and club membership
- **Multi-tournament Coordination**: No centralized system for managing multiple concurrent tournaments
- **Language Barriers**: Tools often only available in English, limiting accessibility in Swedish-speaking clubs

The lack of integrated, automated tournament management creates friction that discourages tournament participation and places excessive burden on organizers.
